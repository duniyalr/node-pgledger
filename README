# Node Pg Ledger

This repository contains essentials for using [pgledger](https://github.com/pgr0ss/pgledger) on the Node platform.
Pgledger is a fantastic and lightweight project for implementing a ledger system on Postgres.
By handling the heavy lifting, Pgledger enables platform-specific libraries to build on top of it
and provide convenient wrapper code for easier usage.

Node PgLedger provides strongly-typed interfaces and convenient methods for interacting with pgLedger,
making it easier to integrate ledger functionality into Node applications.
